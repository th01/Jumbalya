			Jumbalya was originally written as a Ruby text scrambling method (no password) that I wrote in a night for 
			fun. It worked by taking the original input text and assigning a numerical 2 digit code to each character 
			(e.g. A = 96 and ! = 99), then performing a number of systematic shifts, it converted the input into something 
			visually similar to what it returns now.
		</p>

			As time went on I discovered SHA-1, a cryptographic hash function that irreversibly but consistently converts any 
			text input into a 40 character hexadecimal number. I decided to implement this into my original design by digesting 
			a salted password with SHA-1, then use the hexadecimal output to control both the shifts performed for the encryption 
			method and the shifts on where to grab the next value from the SHA-1 hash value. Long story short, I'm confident that 
			someone using anything other than brute-force attack, couldn't decrypt the output. But I'll buy you a cookie if you 
			can. Lastly, if for some reason I decide to change the encryption method somewhere down the road, I added in some 
			reverse compatibility by prefixing every output with 'aa'. the original decryption method will recognize the prefix and 
			work accordingly.

			With a working method in place, I decided to deploy 'Jumbalya' as a web application on Heroku with a Sinatra back-end 
			serving it as a single page application with two post routes and AngularJS and Bootstrap to tie the front-end together.
