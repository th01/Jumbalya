      Jumbalya was originally written as a Ruby text scrambling method (no password) that I wrote in
      a night for fun. It worked by taking the original input text and assigning a numerical 2 digit
      code to each character (e.g. A = 96 and ! = 99), then performing a number of systematic shifts,
      it converted the input into something visually similar to what it returns now. I sat on the
      method for a few months until I was finished at MakerSquare before I decided to build it out
      into a full blown web application with some added modifications that I picked up along the way.

      One of the things I discovered along the way was SHA-1, a cryptographic hash function that
      irreversibly but consistently converts any text input into a 40 character hexadecimal number.
      I decided to implement this into my original design by digesting a salted password with SHA-1,
      then use the hexadecimal output to control both the shifts performed for the encryption method
      and the shifts on where to grab the next value from the SHA-1 hash value. Long story short,
      I'm confident that someone using anything other than brute-force attack, couldn't decrypt the
      output. Lastly, if for some reason I decide to change the encryption method somewhere down the
      road, I added in some reverse compatibility by prefixing every output with 'aa'. The original
      decryption method will recognize the prefix and decrypt with the correct algorithm accordingly.

      With a working method in place, I decided to deploy 'Jumbalya' as a web application on Heroku
      with a Sinatra back-end serving it as a single page application with two post routes and
      AngularJS and Bootstrap to tie the front-end together.
